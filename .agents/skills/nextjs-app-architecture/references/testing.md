# End-to-end tests

What this architecture makes testable, and how to assert it. Test-runner mechanics come from the [Playwright guide](https://preview.nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright) and the [`instant()` reference](https://preview.nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/instant-navigation#prevent-regressions-with-e2e-tests); this page only decides what a test should claim.

## Assert the loading sequence, not the data

The invariants put static chrome outside boundaries and data-dependent bodies inside them, so the thing worth locking in is which content is available before uncached work resolves. `instant()` from `@next/playwright` pauses that work while its callback runs:

- Inside the callback, assert that the chrome and the cached or prefetched content are visible, and that deferred content is absent (`toHaveCount(0)`).
- After the callback, assert that the deferred content arrives.

For an initial load, the callback wraps `page.goto()`. For a client navigation, it wraps the click and `waitForURL`; hover the link first when the app prefetches on intent, so the per-link prefetch has a chance to resolve. Content behind `unstable_navigation()` must be absent inside the callback and present after it.

Do not assert on skeletons. A fallback can be replaced before the assertion runs, and its text or shape is an implementation detail. Assert on the content that replaces it.

## Locate content by what the user sees

Prefer roles and names (`getByRole('heading', { name })`, `getByRole('button', { name })`) over test ids. When a test id is needed for a data-dependent body, put it on the feature component's root element, not in the page, so pages can be recomposed without touching tests.

Next.js keeps recently visited segments mounted in a hidden [`<Activity>`](https://preview.nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/preserving-ui-state), so after a client navigation the previous route's rows, headings and buttons are still in the DOM. Use [visibility-aware selectors](https://preview.nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/preserving-ui-state#use-visibility-aware-selectors) (`filter({ visible: true })`) for anything that exists on more than one route, or a strict-mode locator resolves to both copies. A button that appears in a list row and in a detail toolbar needs to be scoped to its container for the same reason.

## Mutations

A test that stars, archives, replies or creates data changes what later tests see. Run such suites with one worker against a seeded database, and re-seed before a run rather than trying to undo each change. Cached reads outlive the rows they came from, so a re-seed under a running dev server produces mixed data; start the server fresh, which is what a Playwright `webServer` does.

Assert a mutation through the UI it changes: the row loses its unread marker, the count in the sidebar drops, the reply becomes the newest message. Optimistic state settles into server state, so wait for the server-confirmed result (`toHaveCount`, `toHaveAttribute`) rather than the intermediate one.
