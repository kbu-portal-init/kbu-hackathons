# Next.js App Architecture Skill

An agent skill for building or auditing Next.js 16+ App Router apps. It packages the patterns from [Component Architecture for React Server Components](https://aurorascharff.no/posts/component-architecture-for-react-server-components/) and the [next-beats](https://github.com/vercel-labs/next-beats) reference app into a form AI coding agents can load and apply.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add aurorascharff/nextjs-app-architecture-skill
```

## Rules

- **Pages are synchronous compositors.** They don't fetch, they compose.
- **Async components fetch their own data.** Co-locate the read with the JSX.
- **Route props stop at the page.** Components receive IDs, slugs, parsed filters, or records — not raw `params` / `searchParams`.
- **Skeletons live next to their component.** Same file, exported alongside it.
- **Suspense boundaries go at the page level.** The page designs the loading sequence.
- **Client boundaries are leaf nodes.** Push `'use client'` as deep as it can go.

## Documentation

The skill preserves the opinionated architecture rules and project-tested edge cases. Framework mechanics come from the project's version-matched Next.js docs, following the [AI Coding Agents guide](https://preview.nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/ai-agents), rather than being redefined here. Canary-only APIs link to `preview.nextjs.org`.

## References

The `SKILL.md` overview is always loaded; references split into two zones so the agent pulls only what the task needs.

**Core** (any RSC app):

- [`references/feature-folders.md`](references/feature-folders.md) — folder layout, naming, merging sub-concepts, action/query file naming.
- [`references/queries-actions.md`](references/queries-actions.md) — server-only queries, selective same-request dedup, server actions, validation, and cache/tag invalidation.
- [`references/components.md`](references/components.md) — async server components, skeletons without alias wrappers, client boundary, promise + `use()`, single-use helpers, polling.
- [`references/pages-suspense.md`](references/pages-suspense.md) — page composition, `PageProps` / `LayoutProps`, `params.then()`, Suspense placement, CLS prevention, error boundaries.
- [`references/testing.md`](references/testing.md) — end-to-end tests: the loading sequence with `instant()`, hidden routes, mutations.
- [`references/example.md`](references/example.md) — next-beats invariant map and supporting patterns.

**Instant Apps** (opt-in, load only when optimizing for instant-feeling apps):

- [`references/instant-navigation.md`](references/instant-navigation.md) — `prefetch={true}`, the three render stages and their gates, validating navigations, hidden routes.
- [`references/cache-components.md`](references/cache-components.md) — `cacheComponents: true`, the static shell, which reads to cache, `'use cache'` variants, `cacheTag` / `cacheLife`, `updateTag` / `revalidateTag`, and `io()` vs `connection()`.
- [`references/single-page-applications.md`](references/single-page-applications.md) — SPA-style client caching and navigation patterns.
- [`references/ux-patterns.md`](references/ux-patterns.md) — `useOptimistic`, toasts, pending state via `data-pending`, destructive flows, the action-prop pattern, URL pagination, `useFormStatus`.
